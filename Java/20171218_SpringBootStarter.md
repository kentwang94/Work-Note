### BEFORE THIS NOTE
This note (these notes), AKA Learn SpringBoot, is mainly reading notes. I haven't experienced much real project yet, and the words are mainly copy from multiple internet sources(github, wiki and etc.). Therefore some knowledge may be not very useful/ practible, and some conlcusion I made can be inaccurate.

### POJO (Plain Ordinary /Old Java Object)
+ A Java object that only contains attributes, getter and setter.
+ Difference from JavaBean: [Reference: Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object#JavaBeans)
	- A JavaBean is a POJO that is serializable, has a no-argument constructor, and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods that follow a simple naming convention.

### DTO (Data Transfer Object)
+ A DTO is an object that carries data between processes.
+ [Reference: Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object)

### iBATIS
+ The relationship
	- DAO <--> iBATIS/Hibernate <--> Database
+ iBATIS is a persistence framework which automates the mapping between SQL databases and objects in Java, .NET, and Ruby on Rails.
+ Difference between Hibernate & iBATIS
	- Other persistence frameworks such as Hibernate allow the creation of an object model (in Java, say) by the user, and create and maintain the relational database automatically. iBATIS takes the reverse approach: the developer starts with a SQL database and iBATIS automates the creation of the Java objects.
	- [Reference: Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBATIS)
+ Some also say: Hibernate is "full-automatic" database controller, and iBATIS is "semi-automatic". When the SQL that generated by Hibernate aren't efficient enough or we don't have fully control of DB, we can use iBATIS. [Reference: baike](https://baike.baidu.com/item/ibatis/10787592?fr=aladdin)

### WSDL (Web Services Description Language)

WSDL, as the name suggests, describes what, where and how the web services it can provides. In other words, it is kind of a third party APIs. Some websites do provides both way for users to access data.
